## Need to learn derivatives, maybe???

Making the neural network

	Make adding and taking away nodes and layers easy so that quick tests can be done
to determine best number of nodes, hidden layers etc

	Choose activation func for a reason
	Same for all other funcs
	Can use multiple functions in one neural network, e.g. combining reLU and sigmoid
